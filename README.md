# blog-project
blog, pet-project

This project serves as a blog where you can read articles by different authors and create your own. There is also an opportunity to discuss with others in the comments or put
or put a reaction to an existing one. The project includes: registration, authorization, home page, article page, author's posts page, profile page,
article creation page and a sufficient amount of functionality.

I used a stack for implementation:
- JS
- NodeJS/ExpressJS
- Handlebars
- MySQL
